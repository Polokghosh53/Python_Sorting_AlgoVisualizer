It is a visualisation of **IN-PLACE** sorting algorithms to learn the understanding of the algorithm work.

## Programming language used:
-> Python

## Packages used👨🏻‍💻:
-> **Pygame**:
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.
Docs: https://www.pygame.org/docs/

-> **Random**:
In-built package module.

## Process📄:
1. ```git clone https://github.com/Polokghosh53/Python_Sorting_AlgoVisualizer.git```
2. ```cd Python_Sorting_AlgoVisualizer```
3. Open VSCode or PyCharm
4. In the terminal of the editor, ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**Note:** In-place has been mentioned here as those sorting algorithms will only work for certain technique used here.
